This tool can make all species a diamond, the appropriate species a Great one, or have a rare fur.

The following mods are possible with this tool:
1. Make an animal a Great One.
1. Make an animal a Diamond.

Testing with game version: 2649775

## Limitations:
* This tool was tested on Windows 11 with the game installed via Steam. It is smart enough to also look where Epic Games saves its files too. If your game files are saved somewhere else besides where Steam or Epic saves them, use the `Configure Game Path` button.
* The species that use the newer TruRACS trophy system may not become a diamond. This is an area where I am still doing research to figure out how exactly to manipulate.
* If you use the executables (EXE) files, your system may complain there is a virus. This is not true, but the `pyinstaller` package that builds the executable is often used by hackers, and so it is being flagged. To avoid this, simply install the tool from the `wheel` file or build it from source.
